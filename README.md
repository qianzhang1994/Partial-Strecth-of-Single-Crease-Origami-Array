# Partial-Strecth-of-Single-Crease-Origami-Array
This repository contains a parametric program developed to systematically analyze the instability behavior of single crease origami arrays under partial stretch. The program is designed to replicate and extend the findings presented in the paper "Instability Behavior of Single Crease Origami Array Under Partial Stretch".
